My name is jean-hugues DOUMBE KINGUE. I am a software engineer
and freelance web developer based in Lyon, France. I like learning new things and building apps just for fun or
for solving problems fills me with joy.

My work currently consists of a full time developer role for an IT company and managing
ongoing freelance clients and side projects. I find this balancing act
to be super resourceful in terms of learning as a web developer, as well as
for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.

Whether you're a business owner looking to get started on a app or web
development project with a freelance web developer, a developer
looking to collaborate on something cool, or just wanting to say hi,
shoot me a message and let's work together.
